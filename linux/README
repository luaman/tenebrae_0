This part of the tenebrae source tree deals with linux build. This file poorly
documents the build procedure. Have look in tenebrae forum for tips and work around
on this topic.

This is a quite simple build procedure :

ln -s Makefile.i386linux Makefile
make 

By default, the program will consider /usr/local/share/games/quake
as the directory where the id1 and tenebrae directories are to be found. 
You can change this by adding MASTER_DIR=<quake_dir> to the make command.

If everything goes right, you can launch debugi386.glibc/bin/tenebrae.run 
which has just been generated. Otherwise, please have a look at bug reports, 
forums, and if you don't find an answer, report the bug on the website.
